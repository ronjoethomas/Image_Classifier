# Image_Classifier
Utilizing Deep learning to implement a basic image classifier with the help of Pytorch.

Note: Need to download the dataset of cats and dogs and write the location in 'data_directory' field in the code in order to use. This can be any dataset of cats and dogs but you can use the one provided by a kaggle user https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data .

Run 'main' file if you only want to see the newly trained model working without the actual training part

Run image_classifier if you want to see the training part aswell. Make sure for this to have a full data set with test/train for cats and dogs.

The choice of cats and dogs is arbitrary. You can classify any 2 items through this code. If more items need to be classified, run image_classifier and retrain the model for different number of outputs. You may also need to run the code for more epochs. For the visual, you may also need to change number of bars, and plots
